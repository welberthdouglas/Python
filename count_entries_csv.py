# using pandas this can be done with the method value_counts()!!



#Example

# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(csv_file,c_size,colname):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
    counts_dict = {}

    # Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(csv_file,chunksize=c_size):

        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in chunk[colname]:
            if entry in counts_dict.keys():
                counts_dict[entry] += 1
            else:
                counts_dict[entry] = 1

    # Return counts_dict
    return counts_dict
